This writing guide helps you to produce content and related communications for our organisation’s website.

It features tips, examples and an editorial style guide to help make sure the content that is produced for our website and other digital channels is clear, usable, customer-friendly and most importantly consistent.

When writing content for our website, try to keep its vision statement in mind:

> Our website will give people quick and easy access to our services and clear information about life and work in Barnsley

Bear in mind that this guide applies specifically to writing for the web. Although it requires similar skills and techniques to writing for print, there are a few factors that make it different:

* People are much more impatient on the web – they have a problem to solve, a task to complete, and they need the one thing that meets their immediate need quickly.
* People scan rather than read on the web, so layout (paragraph breaks, headings, sub headings, bulleted lists) is very important.
* They read less of what’s on the page – typically about 20–25% of what we’ve written. So we can’t afford to waste a single word.
* Links – we need to use links cleverly to speed up the user’s journey – that could mean signposting them within our site, or linking out to a different site.
* Literal language – there’s no room in website copy for anything figurative, flowery or metaphorical. We need to be specific and make sure every phrase carries important information.
* Keywords – we need to make sure that terms users are looking for are featured prominently in our content. Using them upfront – in sentences as well as headings – helps users scan, and also helps with search engine optimisation (SEO).

# Our voice

Although at the council we are one organisation, we have many departments that do very different things.

All departments should communicate using the same rules, so that there is a single customer experience for our users when they deal with the council.

## Tone of voice

Tone of voice is the way we communicate at Barnsley Council, and in this context, the words we choose to use for digital communications with our customers and visitors to our website.

It’s our job, as content and service providers, to give people access to our information and services online as quickly and efficiently as we can. The way we speak influences how our customers access our services online and the quality of their transaction or time spent with us. Having a set of tone of voice principles helps us to make sure customers and visitors to our website have a consistent experience of Barnsley Council, whatever they’re looking for.

We have three ‘values’ that represent our personality:

* helpful
* direct
* no jargon

These values guide the style of our writing and help us find the right words when we’re producing communications.

## Our personality in action

It’s much easier to understand the Barnsley Council tone of voice when you see it in action. We’ve organised some handy do and don’t examples under our tone of voice values to help you get things right.

Being helpful means:

* involving the audience
* saying ‘you’
* speaking clearly
* using questions

| Helpful isn't | Helpful is |
| ------------- | ---------- |
| If you wish to pay by another method or are having difficulty in paying your bills please refer to our other ways to pay page | Struggling to pay? Need another way to pay? Find out about other ways to pay |
| Inter-library loans may be borrowed from many types of library including public, university and special as well as the British Lending Library | Can’t find what you want? You can borrow items from other libraries |

Being direct means:

* shorter sentences – aim for no more than 20 words, and a mix of sentence lengths to make content readable
* active verbs where possible – ‘We collect bins’, not ‘Bins are collected’
* positive language – use words that encourage eg ‘You can…’, or ‘Apply for…’
* shortening verbs – isn’t for is not; you’re for you are

| Direct isn’t | Direct is |
| ------------ | --------- |
| Guidance on how the general public can gain access to recorded information held by public bodies | How to ask for access to council information |
| Certain factors are taken into consideration that will determine what action is to be taken by the council such as, size and depth of the pothole, speed and volume of traffic and position of the pothole on the road or footpath    | We’ll make a decision on what to do about the pothole by looking at: <ul><li>size and depth</li><li>position on road and footpath</li><li>speed and volume of traffic</li></ul> |
| Failure to register your baby’s birth may leave you liable to prosecution but will also make it impossible for you to receive family allowance or register your baby with a doctor | If you don’t register your baby’s birth, you won’t be able to get family allowance or register your baby with a doctor. There’s a risk you could be brought to court too |

No jargon means:

* using phrases that everyone can understand
* finding different ways of talking about services
* avoiding acronyms (where initials are used to abbreviate) where you can
* avoiding ‘council speak’

| No jargon isn’t | No jargon is |
| --------------- | ------------ |
| The council supplements this approach by providing grit bins at strategic locations on non-primary routes to allow self-help by motorists and pedestrians who encounter difficulties in adverse weather conditions | On other routes, we provide grit bins where they are needed, so you can grit the road or pavement yourself |
| Household bin collection | Collecting everyday rubbish |

## Our name

Our name is a key part of our brand and we write it in every communication we make.

Wherever you can, use ‘we’ when you talk about Barnsley Council, what we do and what we can do. We’re a council providing services to nearly a quarter of a million people locally, and more besides, including tourists, visitors, businesses and investors. Sometimes you’ll need to talk about Barnsley Council in the third person, such as if you’re introducing us for the first time, or writing a more formal communication like a report:

> Barnsley Council supports people with different needs, helping them to live as full lives as possible

We use ‘we’ (first person plural) when we talk to customers, or talk about the council’s activities and attitudes:

> We will assess your application…

But when talking about what customers can do, use ‘you’ (second person) as much as you can – it reflects the way customers think and speak:

> You can set up a direct debit…

We use the third person (‘is’, ‘does’, etc) when we introduce Barnsley Council for the first time, or in more formal communications:

> Barnsley Council serves the needs of almost a quarter of a million people…

If you need to be a bit more specific – for example, to refer to a particular department – it’s fine to mention that, and then go back to using ‘we’:

> As a highway authority, we are responsible for…

## Writing for different audiences

While much of our site is aimed at the general public in Barnsley, some parts are more specialised.

For example, we have pages specifically for landlords, business owners, and people working in child protection.

Each of these audiences requires a slightly different ‘voice’. It’s a matter of thinking about our existing tone of voice, and deciding how to mix the values in different proportions to get the voice we want.

For example, a piece of guidance that has legal implications may need to be less ‘direct’, because fullness and accuracy are important. Similarly, a page that is aimed at a particular audience may use specialist terms which, to anyone else, would look like jargon. So we would ease off on the ‘no jargon’ principle, while remaining as ‘direct’ and ‘helpful’ as possible.

### Assumed knowledge

One thing we need to be careful of is the level of knowledge we assume in our readers. This doesn’t mean that we have to explain everything: but we need to make sure they won’t get confused because they don’t know the specialist terms or background information that may seem obvious to us.

For example: how many members of the public would know what a ‘freedom of information request’ is? Or what the Information Commissioner does? While you don’t have to give a long explanation of these, it’s a good idea to provide links to background information – on other sites, if appropriate – while keeping the page copy focused on what the user wants to achieve.

In some cases, it could be okay to assume that your reader does have some background knowledge – for example, if you’re writing for a specialist audience, they may already be familiar with background terms and concepts. Think carefully about who you are writing for – and if you can, speak to a member of the target audience to check your assumptions.

# Tips for better writing

Inside Barnsley Council we often use jargon, phrases and words that do not mean anything to our customers.

To help people better understand us, we should structure our information in a better way and remove unnecessary words.

## Put yourself in the user’s shoes

Think about the goal or task the user is coming to the website with. How are you going to help them achieve that?

What’s the best way for your content to be presented? Be clear on the purpose of the content you’re writing and if you get stuck, remind yourself of what the user is likely to be looking for.

To help customers in this way, we should include at least one ‘call to action’ on every page that we create. A call to action is something that tries to get the visitor to do something – usually a link, e-form or download. It should be expressed with an action word – ‘apply’, ‘register’, ‘buy’, or just ‘find out more’. To make your main call to action prominent, put it towards the end of the page, ideally on a line by itself. In some cases, the call to action may actually need to appear near the top of the page. Finally, make sure you provide enough information on the page to enable the customer to decide whether they should follow the call to action – or choose the right one for them.

## Plan your structure

Very few of us get structure right instinctively. You need to plan out what your audience wants to know, what you’re going to say and how it will develop.

Setting a word limit helps. Consider your users most obvious question and answer that first, then consider their next likely question, and so on. The inverted pyramid paragraph in section 3 of this document explains more.

## One idea per paragraph

This rule builds on the last one. Sticking to one idea per paragraph helps with structure, clarity and readability

It’s particularly important when writing online, where users read more quickly and scan for content that’s relevant to them.

## Keep sentences short

Keep the average length of your sentences to 15–20 words.

You’ll write sentences longer and shorter than this – but this should be the average length. Long sentences are difficult to read; many readers will lose track halfway through. There are two ways to break down a very long sentence: split it into shorter sentences; or, if it includes a list of words or points, turn it into bullet points.

## Use punctuation correctly

Punctuation is a huge topic in itself, but a good rule of thumb is to punctuate where you would naturally pause, or take a breath, if you were speaking.

Reading your words back to yourself out loud will help you focus on the meaning as well – where the different ideas need to be separated off.

| Don’t say | Do say |
| --------- | ------ |
| Libraries now offer access to IT resources online and can often help to get people started on their online journey by offering short introductory classes or taster sessions | Libraries now offer access to IT resources online; they can often help to get people started on their online journey, by offering short introductory classes or taster sessions |

Here, we’ve added a comma and, to separate off the first bit, a semi-colon. A semi-colon is a bit stronger than a comma – but not as much of a break as a full stop. You could have a full stop here – but because there’s a sense of flow between the ideas, and because ‘they’ refers back to ‘libraries’, we want more of a sense of continuity, so a semi-colon seems right.

## Get rid of unnecessary words

Users want to get to the point of our message, fast. Words that add nothing to the meaning should be deleted.

For example:

| Don’t say | Do say |
| --------- | ------ |
| The proposal that was received from… | The proposal from… |
| We are in the process of preparing a policy statement… | We are preparing a policy statement… |
| We enclose herewith an invoice… | We enclose an invoice… |
| Barnsley Council is currently developing… | Barnsley Council is developing… |

## Tell it like it is

Sounds easy, doesn’t it? Yet plain-speaking content is one of the hardest things to get right.

By using everyday words in the right places, you can give your content a lighter touch. It’s the difference between saying ‘ask for help’ rather than ‘request assistance’. Or ‘we’ll have a chat about your skills’ instead of ‘we’ll discuss your skills’. But remember, ‘telling it like it is’ isn’t the same thing as using slang.

## Use subheadings

Using subheadings makes your copy more readable.

Web users expect it and it’s a good rule of thumb for most communication channels. Subheadings give the reader a heads-up on what to expect from a longer section, helping them to understand content quickly and more easily.

It’s often a good idea to use questions as subheadings, eg ‘Who can foster children?’ A subheading can also be something that covers the action that the customer may want to take, eg ‘How to register as a childminder’.

## Edit your work and ask for a second opinion

Don’t expect to get your copy right first time. The most experienced copywriters edit, revise and redraft their work.

It’s an essential part of the writing process. A second pair of eyes is invaluable when it comes to checking your work. Ask a colleague whose opinion you trust to read your copy and share their thoughts. It’s likely they’ll spot a couple of things you’ve missed or give you some feedback that could improve your draft. Last but not least, get your copy proofed before it goes anywhere.

## Avoid jargon

It’s easy in any organisation to slip into using jargon or ‘business speak’. One of the reasons we use it is to sound professional or to tiptoe round a topic.

On the web, there’s nowhere to hide. By using jargon or business speak, we run the risk of alienating our customers and visitors to our website. Plus people with lower reading ages can find jargon tricky to grasp. Avoid jargon, speak plainly and think of another way of saying that term that you’re trying hard not to use. The same goes for clichés – they make copy sound tired rather than energetic and fresh.

Here are a few examples of business-speak, with suggested replacements:

| Don’t use | Do use |
| --------- | ------ |
| advise | tell |
| additional | extra, more |
| ensure | make sure |
| complete | fill in |
| negligible | small, low |
| on receipt | when you / we get |
| regarding | about |
| whilst | while |
| magnitude | size |

# Web content principles

The most important thing to consider when writing for the web is what users want.

How many times have you been on a site that asks you millions of questions before being given access to the information or tasks you want? Or have you been waylaid by confusing navigation? Were you frustrated? Did you abandon your task or pick up the phone instead?

When a visitor comes to http://www.barnsley.gov.uk (new window), they have a level of goodwill. And to establish trust in our website, we need to make sure we keep this level high. Words are a vital tool for doing this. Even before visitors get to our site.

These next principles for producing great web content should keep us on track and help us design the best possible experience for our customers.

## Visual clarity

Writing for the web is not the same as writing for print.

Perhaps the simplest rule is to have a think about how you read when you’re browsing the web. Use headlines, small amounts of bold (not underlines) to highlight key words, and bulleted lists to make it easy to understand the key points.

## Active, not passive

If you construct a sentence so that the person or thing on the receiving end is upfront, you’re probably using the ‘passive voice’:

* You will be contacted…
* Performance is measured…
* It is assumed that…

It’s better to avoid the passive voice as much as you can in your writing, as it tends to sound formal, vague and unfriendly.

The ‘active voice’ – where we talk about someone actually doing something – usually comes across as sharper and more customer-focused:

| Don’t say | Do say |
| --------- | ------ |
| Household waste will be collected once a week | We collect household waste once a week |

Where you can, it’s often a good idea to use the ‘imperative’ – this is a type of active voice where we don’t use ‘we’ or ‘you’ at all, because we’re giving an instruction – ‘do this’. For example:

> To apply for a permit, complete a Club Gaming Application Form.

It’s not about barking orders at the reader, but about being direct and unambiguous, motivating the reader and striking a confident tone. It’s a good option.

If you’re trying to involve the reader by using ‘you’, it’s easy to fall into the trap of using the passive:

> You will be assessed under the rules…

This doesn’t say who’s doing the assessing – the customer is just having it done to them. In this case, it would be better to say ‘we will assess your situation according to the rules…’

### When the passive is okay

The passive voice is not banned altogether: in certain situations, it can be your best option.

* To make something less hostile: ‘The bill has not been paid’ sounds less accusing than ‘You have not paid the bill’.
* To avoid taking the blame: ‘A mistake was made’ rather than ‘We made a mistake’.
* When you don’t know who did it: ‘A decision was taken…’.
* If it helps the wording or just sounds better: ‘The stadium plans were approved’ – if it doesn’t matter who approved the plans, it’s good to get the important words up front.

These are exceptions though. About 80 to 90% of the verbs that you use should be active.

## Microcopy

‘Microcopy’ means the little bits of text on websites that offer help and instructions to visitors.

This includes things like form labels, pop-up messages, the text on buttons, and the names of links. These all provide opportunities for us to reassure the visitor by given them a useful tip, just at the point where they need it.

For example, when a customer is filling in a form to pay a parking fine, what should the ‘action button’ say? Add to basket? Pay now? Proceed? It’s important that we think through the implications of the words we use in situations like this, and don’t dash them off at the last minute, or leave them to others (such as developers) to write.

Here are a few tips to use when you’re called on to generate microcopy:

* Walk through the process as if you were the customer.
* Provide reassurance – but not extra words for the sake of it. If you want to provide extra information only to people who actually request it, consider putting it behind a help (‘?’) or information (‘i’) button.
* Don’t make too many assumptions about the user’s level of understanding.
* Offer help at the point where it’s needed.
* Avoid jargon at all costs.

## Scannability

Focus on ‘scannability’ – most users scan screens more than they read them, so make sure your copy is easy to interpret at a glance.

Copy should be ‘chunked up’ for screen – see the inverted pyramid principle below.

## The inverted pyramid principle

Write your copy so that the most important information is at the top – that way, people who only read your opening paragraph can still get a clear idea of what that page is about.

This differs to writing for print, where the opening paragraph is often used as an attention grabber and you have the luxury of developing ideas over a number of pages.

## Capitals in headings, menus and titles

Whenever you write a new heading, menu item or article title make sure you use sentence case (only capitalise the first word).

You can still capitalise any words that need it. For example:

* Special educational needs
* Schools in Barnsley
* The council’s Corporate Plan

## Writing links

Make links meaningful: ‘Click here’ and ‘Find out more’ don’t let the user know what to expect from their next action.

‘Download the latest report’ and ‘Find your nearest grit bin’ tell them exactly what they need to know about where they’re going next. This is best practice and is actually a legal requirement of the W3C AA accessibility guidelines.

# Search engine optimisation

The words we use in our copy play a part even before people get to our site.

There are ways we can structure our copy and the terms we use to make it much easier to find in search engines. In many cases, Barnsley Council is the only organisation offering certain services in the area and our visibility in search engines is naturally good. However, we can follow some simple rules to optimise our copy and improve our online search ranking results. This is especially important when it comes to promoting services where we have private sector competitors eg fostering, adult education and land searches.

These guidelines are designed to help you create SEO-friendly copy for each web page.

## Keywords

Tips for writing keywords:

* Write down your key information and then select two to three keywords from that paragraph which you think someone may use to find us using a search engine.
* Then write the rest of the copy, mentioning those keywords between three and six times – but only if it doesn’t sound forced.
* There should be a higher concentration of keywords near the top of the page. Use keywords at least once in your opening paragraph.
* You may wish to review existing pages on your site/microsite to see if you can improve the SEO by copy alone.

## Page content

Tips for writing page content:

* Try to keep each page as unique as possible – if you find yourself moving on to another subject, create another page.
* Anchor text (links) – think about where you place your links in your copy. The higher up the page they appear, the more important search engines consider them to be. 

## Alternative text

Alternative (‘Alt’) text is the description that goes along with every image, for the benefit of people who use a screen reader or browse with images turned off.

It’s a good idea to put keywords in your Alt text. Rather than writing, ‘Woman using computer’ write, ‘Woman searching for information about getting married from Barnsley Council’. (The accessibility section has more about Alt text.)

# Accessibility

As a council working for everyone in the borough, we need to make our information available to people with a wide range of needs and abilities.

Considering these needs is part of our commitment to providing clear information for everyone.

It’s a government requirement that all public sector websites meet W3C guidelines on accessibility to AA standard. The content we produce is also covered by disability and equality legislation.

Some of the work needed to achieve this and meet those requirements is technical – but much of it is about how we, as writers and editors, develop our content. The following points will help you write content that meets accessibility standards.

* Provide a text alternative (‘alt text’) for all images (unless they are purely decorative), as users may be using a screen reader to view the page. Make sure the text expresses all of the information in the image – if it’s an infographic, this may mean you need to duplicate the information in a table, or as plain text.
* Keep language simple – some users may have learning difficulties and struggle to read long sentences. Break your content up into short sentences, use subheadings and bullets to make structure more obvious, and use simple words as much as you can. (The average reading age in the UK is 9, so lowering the reading age of what you’ve written doesn’t just help people with special needs – it’s probably going to help the majority of your readers.)
* Ensure all links make sense out of context – this will help all customers, but particularly people using screen readers, who may use the Tab key to jump from link to link, or fire up a box that gives an alphabetical list of links. Avoid terms like ‘Click here’ and ‘Read more’, as these will not be meaningful to non-sighted users, particularly if repeated throughout the page.
* Non-HTML content, such as audio and video material, should be as accessible as possible. You can provide an accessible alternative by writing a meaningful transcript or exploring a different way of presenting information.
* Inform the user in the link if a new window will open. This is best practice for usability, as well as a requirement of the W3C AA accessibility guidelines.
* Links should be within your page text – do not embed them in an image.
* Clearly identify information about any attachments within link text. This gives screen reader users the information they need about a download, within the link itself.

# Our editorial style

The editorial guidance in this section is founded on modern grammar and style standards.

The [GOV.UK style guide](https://www.gov.uk/designprinciples/styleguide) (new window) is a good reference manual for anyone involved in delivering public service content, and many of those standards are echoed here.

Style guides aren't like dictionaries, set in stone until the next edition, occasionally used, and gathering dust on a shelf. This style guide is a living document, that’s improved by each new standard which gets added. It’s up to you as content editors to own the guide, keep it up to date and as useful as it can be for producing consistent and customer-friendly content for <www.barnsley.gov.uk> (new window).

Content is organised alphabetically. We've tried hard to cover the most common standards for producing content, but no style guide can ever be complete.

## Abbreviations

Abbreviations which are well-known, like MP, VAT or UK, should appear in this shortened format and not be spelled out in full.

Remember your audience: if you’re not sure that an abbreviation is widely understood, then spell it out in full first, with the shortened form in brackets.

> Small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)

Use just the abbreviation without brackets on second and further mentions in the same document or section of copy:

> We can help SMEs to find information relevant to their business.

There’s no need to use full stops after letters in abbreviations: BBC, not B.B.C.

## And

Use ‘and’ in full, rather than the ampersand symbol ‘&’. And feel free to use ‘and’ at the start of a sentence too.

| Don’t use | Do use |
| --------- | ------ |
| Leisure & Culture | Leisure and Culture |

## Acronyms

Acronyms are abbreviations that can be pronounced as a word. Use a capital for the first letter only.

* Nato
* Ipsos MORI
* Sats

## Apostrophies

Don’t use an apostrophe in plurals such as: FAQs, NVQs, MAs, CDs and the 1960s. The apostrophe is used to show possession: The dog’s dinner.

But there is no apostrophe in his, hers, ours, yours, theirs or its. These words are possessive pronouns and don’t need apostrophes to show possession.

An apostrophe may also indicate contraction (where two words become one):

* don’t, you’ve, she’s, they’ll and it’s (short for ‘it is’)

## Brackets

Use round brackets.

We’re with GOV.UK on this: the only time you should use square brackets is when you’re adding a note into reported speech.

Brackets should contain any punctuation that applies to the words within the brackets.

## Bulleted lists

The aim here is to help readers visualise a list easily. All bulleted lists start with a lead-in sentence.

Where the bullet points comprise a list of single words or short statements, begin each line with a lowercase letter and use no punctuation – except to introduce it with a colon.

A positive working environment is defined by the following characteristics:

* teamwork
* creativity
* trust
* opportunities for career development
* a sense of loyalty

Where the bullet points are complete sentences, then introduce the list with a colon and begin each point with a capital letter and punctuate with full stops, for example:

The key findings of the survey are as follows:

* The most popular reason for choosing the course was to gain a qualification.
* Nearly 90% of the respondents feel they have chosen the right course or programme.
* More than 75% of respondents are satisfied with the facilities provided (office and laboratory space, computers, etc).

Where bullet points are a mixture of both, then choose one of the above two styles and stick to it. Whichever type of list you use, introduce it with a colon. You can include links and downloads as part of bulleted lists if you need to.

## Capitals

Avoid using capitals where you can. Only use them at the beginning of sentences or for proper nouns. Don’t use capitals unless they’re needed grammatically.

Quick guide to using capitals:

| Type | Example |
| ---- | ------- |
| Days of the week | Sunday, Monday |
| Months | January (but NOT seasons: summer/winter) |
| Holidays and holy days | Christmas, Easter, Ramadan |
| Laws and acts | Housing Reform Bill |
| Most trade names | Sellotape, Mars bar |
| Formal titles | Prime Minister, Councillor |
| Planets and heavenly bodies | Mars, Earth, the Milky Way |
| Continents | Australia, Africa |
| Streets, roads and motorways | County Way, M1 |
| Landforms | the Peak District, the Sahara Desert |
| Bodies of water | River Rother, River Don |
| Languages | English, Spanish |

Common council terms and when to capitalise them:

| Capitals | Lowercase |
| -------- | --------- |
| Barnsley Council<br/>Barnsley Council serves… | the council says <br/> the council minutes |
| Councillor Smith | the councillor speaks <br/> councillors met |
| Local Government Association | the government |
| Adults and Communities; Development, Environment and Culture | the department is responsible for |
| Joan Smith, Web Manager | the web manager for Barnsley Council |

## Commas

Commas are used in lists within a sentence:

> We are responsible for schools, colleges and other educational establishments.

Only include a comma before the word ‘and’ if leaving it out would cause confusion.

The comma may mark off a word or phrase: You, perhaps, think otherwise.

It can also separate descriptive phrases: Councillor Smith, an elected member, will also attend.

Commas also indicate a small pause that would occur in normal speech.

## Colon and semicolon

The main purpose of the colon is to point forward, indicating ‘here it comes’. In the same way, introduce a list with a colon:

* a pencil
* a pen
* a crayon

The semi-colon links two strongly associated (or contrasting) clauses or sentences.

He knows local government inside out; he has worked as an officer all his life.

Pop into your local library; it’s full of books and things to do.

## Contractions

Contractions mean shortened forms of words or word groups. In this case we use it to refer to shortening verbs.

Use common contractions when producing web content, as they help users scan content and they’re friendlier.

| Don’t use | Do use |
| --------- | ------ |
| could’ve, should’ve, would’ve (these can be hard to read) | we’ll, you’ll, we’ve, can’t, won’t, isn’t, aren’t, and so on |

## Dashes

In practice, you’ll use a hyphen on screen in all the cases described below.

That’s because we recommend you don’t use the dash for onscreen text. We’ve included the guidance in the interests of clarity and if you come across hyphens and dashes in a print medium.

The dash – (actually called en dash) can be typed in two ways: Ctrl + minus key or use the symbol tab in the Insert menu in Word.

The en dash is longer than the hyphen and is used for different purposes.

It can be used like a strong comma to separate off an additional point towards the end of a clause or sentence. This kind of dash has a space either side:

* The chairman said he had resigned – he was, in fact, dismissed.

The dash can also be used in a pair, like brackets but slightly weightier. This kind of dash also has a space either side:

* The internet – not the TV – is now our biggest source of information.

It can link words (but not hyphenate them) in a way that stands for ‘and’ or ‘to’. This kind of dash has no spaces either side:

* London–Glasgow train
* 1939–45 (but single year: 2003/4)
* 16–19-year-old students

## Dates

We write our dates like this:

* 25 December 2012

Not like this:

* 25th December 2012
* December 25th 2012
* 25 December 12

We spell days of the week and months in full:

* Monday not Mon, January not Jan
* on 10 September …10 September 2013 … September 2013

Other examples include:

* 1990s (no apostrophe)
* the 20th century … 20th-century trends
* the class of 2007
* 1922–27 or in full when crossing century boundary, 1997–2009
* 26 October–15 November
* for financial year 1998/99, 1999/2000, 2000/02

## Dot dot dot

Three dots (…) – known as an ‘ellipsis’ – are used to indicate a pause in text or an unfinished piece of text.

Use three dots only, with no space between the last word and the first dot, but a space before any word that follows on.

* There’s a lot to say about it… we’ll cover everything off in this leaflet.

## Eg, etc and ie

Shouldn’t have any full stops: eg, etc and ie

A full stop after each letter, as in e.g., is seen as old-fashioned.

## Emphasis

Emphasis should normally be expressed by bold text.

Never underline or use capitals for emphasis.

## Gender

Where appropriate, use a plural noun.

| Don’t say | Do say |
| --------- | ------ |
| The customer can access their account | Customers can access their accounts |

Avoid using the masculine singular (‘he’). Use ‘they’ if possible, or ‘his or her’.

## Hyphens

Use a hyphen to avoid ambiguity when joining words together (to make a compound word), such as cross-section.

Where compound words come before a noun or verb, they are compound modifiers. An example often used to explain these compound modifiers is ‘man-eating shark’ (a shark that eats people) as opposed to a ‘man eating shark’ (with chips and peas).

Examples we might use:

* start-up meeting
* sign-up process
* long-term investment
* 16-year-old students

But note the following do not include hyphens:

* the customer has signed up
* the investment may pay off in the long term
* he is 40 years old

## Italics

Avoid them on screen.

Single quotation marks are better if you’re writing about a report or publication.

## Links and web addresses

Only use http:// for web addresses which don’t have a ‘www’ prefix.

Otherwise, the http:// can be deleted.

## Link copy

Be simple and descriptive, always telling the user what to expect.

## Money

For round figures, miss out the empty decimal places – £1 not £1.00.

Don’t use pound signs on sums under £1. So 55p, not £0.55.
Write million in body text (use m only in tables) – £2.5 million not £2,500,000.

£30 a week, not £30 per week.

Write other currencies in full in body text; use symbols in tables or captions.
$50 (US dollars), euro and cent: no caps, € = euro symbol (normally, Ctrl + Alt + 4).

## Numbers

Tips about writing numbers:

Use words for:

* the numbers one to nine
* approximate or rounded numbers: about a million pounds, half a million customers
* ordinal numbers: first, second, third (not firstly, secondly, thirdly) then 10th etc
* numbers at the beginning of a sentence: Eleven ways to …
* clock times not followed by am or pm: three o’clock
* simple fractions: two thirds, seven eighths

Use figures for:

* numbers after nine: 10, 11, 12 etc
* numbers appearing in tables
* page numbers: page 8, section 7
* when the number is referred to as a number: divided by 3
* comparing: between 3 and 12 customers
* before units of measure: 1 mile, 20cm, 49kg, £1, 9am, 25–29kg (no need to repeat unit) but 
* 5 million–10 million (where the first unit needs clarifying)
* for whole numbers and fractions or awkward fractions: 2 1/2, 1/57
* with decimals and percentages: 2.5%
* in sections where numbers are frequent: 3 oranges, 4 apples, 2 plums
* for educational terms: level 1, Key Stage 2
* for latitude, longitude, temperature, price, score, date, time of day
* always use commas with more than four figures in text: 12,760 and 1,693,452 (but 1098), but use spaces for * numbers in columns and tables: 10 750 30 456

Use ‘more than’ instead of ‘over’ to mean ‘in excess of’. Both are grammatically fine, but ‘more than’ is our preference.

* More than 3 million customers … 

## Quotations

Short quotations of 40 words or less can be run into the text (not italic).

> The councillor said: “Things have improved around here.”

Longer quotations should appear on their own, with a line space above and below. They should be contained in double speech marks.

> “Things have improved around here since the community group was set up. They’ve accessed funding, organised volunteering and really reached out to local people.”

Don’t combine speech marks and italics.

The source details (author, date) should be placed below the quotation, on the next line and aligned with the right-hand margin. Source details should be listed in full in the reference list.

> “Things have improved around here.”
> Councillor Smith, 20 March 2013

Three dots (…) indicate where material has been omitted from the quotation. They are not needed at the beginning or end of a quotation. 

## Singular and plural nouns

When writing about an organisation, we use the singular:

* Barnsley Council serves a population of…
* Berneslai Homes is a housing company…

## Spacing

Leave one space at the end of a sentence after a full stop, not two.

Leaving two spaces is considered old-fashioned

## Speech marks

Use double quotation marks to communicate speech.

* The mayor commented “It’s an historic day for Barnsley and we welcome this news”.

Single quotation marks are for short phrases (not speech) within text.

* The theme of this year’s Deaf Awareness Week is ‘get involved, get aware’. 

To quote within a speech quote, use single quotation marks.

* A cabinet spokesperson explained the proposals: “this is a part of an ongoing programme to ensure the long-term feasibility of services described as ‘essential and valuable’ in a recent council report”.

Punctuation inside the speech marks applies only to that part of the sentence.

Also, enclose slang and technical terms in single quotation marks. For example, when introducing a new term, the word will be in ‘single’ quotation marks initially. Only do this the first time it appears.

## Spell-check

Take care when using a spellchecker – it won’t always pick up mistakes such as using ‘practice’ instead of ‘practise’ or typing ‘rouge’ instead of ‘rogue’.

It may also miss some American spellings which would be considered wrong in British English, such as ‘color’ and ‘neighborhood’. There really is no substitute for having your work checked over by another person!

## Titles and menu tabs

Titles and menu tabs should use capitals only for the first letter of the first word of the title, and for proper names within the title. Don’t use a full stop at the end.

Job titles are different. If the job title comes after the person’s name, capitalise: J Smith, Brand Manager.

If the job title comes before the person’s name, don’t capitalise: brand manager John Smith.

## Titles of official schemes and initiatives

Capitalise titles of this type, as they are proper nouns.

If you’re not sure, search for the correct spelling online. It’s best to do this on the organisation or scheme’s own website to get it right.
