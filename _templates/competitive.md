The competitive templates are designed to provide an edge to services provided by the council that are in direct competition with other suppliers.

Competitive pages are part of the core, corporate website and will be part of  the [corporate template](corporate.html).

Within the corporate template the competitive layouts offer more flexibility and customisation, and take advantage of Umbraco grid layouts to provide this enhanced customisation directly to editors.
