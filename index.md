## Semantic Versioning

We've adopted [semantic versioning](http://semver.org) in order to make it easy to determine the scale and scope of changes. 

In our implementation the version number is as follows *major*.*minor*.*patch*

- A *major* change is a backwards incompatible change, typically a change to the HTML structure on the page that a drop in CSS replacement won't alter.
- A *minor* change is a new feature which is backwards compatible.
- A *patch* change is a small fix to existing code which is backwards compatible.
