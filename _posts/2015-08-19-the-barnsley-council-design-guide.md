The initial release of the Barnsley Council Design Guide. The design guide contains all the principles and components necessary to build branded, effective front-end designs for websites and applications.

This document is a living standard - it will be frequently updated and changes will be captured in release posts like this one.

We've adopted [semantic versioning](http://semver.org) in order to make it easy to determine the scale and scope of changes. 

In our implementation the version number is as follows *major*.*minor*.*patch*

- A *major* change is a backwards incompatible change, for example; a change to the HTML structure on the requiring modification in the application.
- A *minor* change is a new feature which is backwards compatible.
- A *patch* change is a small fix / enhancement to existing code which is backwards compatible.
