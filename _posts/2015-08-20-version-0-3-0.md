We've implemented [Require.js](http://requirejs.org) to make it easier manage scripts by removing any confusion around load order and dependency management. It also opens up the possibility of lazy loading scripts in future as our applications become more complex.

We've had to slightly modify our scripts to make them compatible with the [AMD API](https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api/wiki/AMD). The third party libraries we use (jQuery, jQuery Mobile, Underscore) support AMD by default so no change was necessary.

This documentation has been updated to link directly to the Javascript required by a particular component.
