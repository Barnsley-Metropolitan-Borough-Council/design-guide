You should checkout the Barnsley Council SCSS files and create your own _manifest.scss in your project. 

Customising your manifest file allows you to only include the CSS rules for components you intend to use reducing bloat and creating leaner, faster code.

## Required tools

- Node.js
- Gulp
    + gulp-sass
    + gulp-minify-css
    + gulp-rename
    + gulp-autoprefixer
    + del
- sass

## Installation

## Build process

Run `gulp build` to compile your css and javascript.
