## Browser Compatibility

We aim to support the following browsers at a minimum, we should make effort to support browsers with reasonable market share (but not beta or development browsers).

## Javascript

Our applications and websites need to be functional for users with Javascript enabled or disabled. Javascript should be used to provide [enhanced functionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement) for users with it enabled. We must not discriminate against users with Javascript disabled.

## Accessibility

We are legally and morally obligated to ensure our applications comply with [WCAG 2.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) to a minimum standard of AA. 

Consider how people using phones, screen readers and search engines will access and use the site.

# Mobile first

Our sites and web applications should be designed with mobile first in mind, doing this will enable us to provide a usable, focused baseline for our applications, and provide compatibility with future devices.
