## Personal details

We should only ask for personal details when customers need access to their private information. Reporting something to us that is not personal to the customer should be possible anonymously. 

## Important first

When presenting forms to customers the most important information should be the first questions we ask. For example; When reporting graffiti the first information the customer should be asked for is the location of the graffiti.
