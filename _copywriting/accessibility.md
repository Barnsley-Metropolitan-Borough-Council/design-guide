As a council working for everyone in the borough, we need to make our information available to people with a wide range of needs and abilities.

Considering these needs is part of our commitment to providing clear information for everyone.

It’s a government requirement that all public sector websites meet W3C guidelines on accessibility to AA standard. The content we produce is also covered by disability and equality legislation.

Some of the work needed to achieve this and meet those requirements is technical – but much of it is about how we, as writers and editors, develop our content. The following points will help you write content that meets accessibility standards.

* Provide a text alternative (‘alt text’) for all images (unless they are purely decorative), as users may be using a screen reader to view the page. Make sure the text expresses all of the information in the image – if it’s an infographic, this may mean you need to duplicate the information in a table, or as plain text.
* Keep language simple – some users may have learning difficulties and struggle to read long sentences. Break your content up into short sentences, use subheadings and bullets to make structure more obvious, and use simple words as much as you can. (The average reading age in the UK is 9, so lowering the reading age of what you’ve written doesn’t just help people with special needs – it’s probably going to help the majority of your readers.)
* Ensure all links make sense out of context – this will help all customers, but particularly people using screen readers, who may use the Tab key to jump from link to link, or fire up a box that gives an alphabetical list of links. Avoid terms like ‘Click here’ and ‘Read more’, as these will not be meaningful to non-sighted users, particularly if repeated throughout the page.
* Non-HTML content, such as audio and video material, should be as accessible as possible. You can provide an accessible alternative by writing a meaningful transcript or exploring a different way of presenting information.
* Inform the user in the link if a new window will open. This is best practice for usability, as well as a requirement of the W3C AA accessibility guidelines.
* Links should be within your page text – do not embed them in an image.
* Clearly identify information about any attachments within link text. This gives screen reader users the information they need about a download, within the link itself.
