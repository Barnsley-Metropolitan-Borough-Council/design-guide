This writing guide helps you to produce content and related communications for our organisation’s website.

It features tips, examples and an editorial style guide to help make sure the content that is produced for our website and other digital channels is clear, usable, customer-friendly and most importantly consistent.

When writing content for our website, try to keep its vision statement in mind:

> Our website will give people quick and easy access to our services and clear information about life and work in Barnsley

Bear in mind that this guide applies specifically to writing for the web. Although it requires similar skills and techniques to writing for print, there are a few factors that make it different:

* People are much more impatient on the web – they have a problem to solve, a task to complete, and they need the one thing that meets their immediate need quickly.
* People scan rather than read on the web, so layout (paragraph breaks, headings, sub headings, bulleted lists) is very important.
* They read less of what’s on the page – typically about 20–25% of what we’ve written. So we can’t afford to waste a single word.
* Links – we need to use links cleverly to speed up the user’s journey – that could mean signposting them within our site, or linking out to a different site.
* Literal language – there’s no room in website copy for anything figurative, flowery or metaphorical. We need to be specific and make sure every phrase carries important information.
* Keywords – we need to make sure that terms users are looking for are featured prominently in our content. Using them upfront – in sentences as well as headings – helps users scan, and also helps with search engine optimisation (SEO).
