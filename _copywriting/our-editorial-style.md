The editorial guidance in this section is founded on modern grammar and style standards.

The [GOV.UK style guide](https://www.gov.uk/designprinciples/styleguide) (new window) is a good reference manual for anyone involved in delivering public service content, and many of those standards are echoed here.

Style guides aren't like dictionaries, set in stone until the next edition, occasionally used, and gathering dust on a shelf. This style guide is a living document, that’s improved by each new standard which gets added. It’s up to you as content editors to own the guide, keep it up to date and as useful as it can be for producing consistent and customer-friendly content for <www.barnsley.gov.uk> (new window).

Content is organised alphabetically. We've tried hard to cover the most common standards for producing content, but no style guide can ever be complete.

## Abbreviations

Abbreviations which are well-known, like MP, VAT or UK, should appear in this shortened format and not be spelled out in full.

Remember your audience: if you’re not sure that an abbreviation is widely understood, then spell it out in full first, with the shortened form in brackets.

> Small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)

Use just the abbreviation without brackets on second and further mentions in the same document or section of copy:

> We can help SMEs to find information relevant to their business.

There’s no need to use full stops after letters in abbreviations: BBC, not B.B.C.

## And

Use ‘and’ in full, rather than the ampersand symbol ‘&’. And feel free to use ‘and’ at the start of a sentence too.

| Don’t use | Do use |
| --------- | ------ |
| Leisure & Culture | Leisure and Culture |

## Acronyms

Acronyms are abbreviations that can be pronounced as a word. Use a capital for the first letter only.

* Nato
* Ipsos MORI
* Sats

## Apostrophies

Don’t use an apostrophe in plurals such as: FAQs, NVQs, MAs, CDs and the 1960s. The apostrophe is used to show possession: The dog’s dinner.

But there is no apostrophe in his, hers, ours, yours, theirs or its. These words are possessive pronouns and don’t need apostrophes to show possession.

An apostrophe may also indicate contraction (where two words become one):

* don’t, you’ve, she’s, they’ll and it’s (short for ‘it is’)

## Brackets

Use round brackets.

We’re with GOV.UK on this: the only time you should use square brackets is when you’re adding a note into reported speech.

Brackets should contain any punctuation that applies to the words within the brackets.

## Bulleted lists

The aim here is to help readers visualise a list easily. All bulleted lists start with a lead-in sentence.

Where the bullet points comprise a list of single words or short statements, begin each line with a lowercase letter and use no punctuation – except to introduce it with a colon.

A positive working environment is defined by the following characteristics:

* teamwork
* creativity
* trust
* opportunities for career development
* a sense of loyalty

Where the bullet points are complete sentences, then introduce the list with a colon and begin each point with a capital letter and punctuate with full stops, for example:

The key findings of the survey are as follows:

* The most popular reason for choosing the course was to gain a qualification.
* Nearly 90% of the respondents feel they have chosen the right course or programme.
* More than 75% of respondents are satisfied with the facilities provided (office and laboratory space, computers, etc).

Where bullet points are a mixture of both, then choose one of the above two styles and stick to it. Whichever type of list you use, introduce it with a colon. You can include links and downloads as part of bulleted lists if you need to.

## Capitals

Avoid using capitals where you can. Only use them at the beginning of sentences or for proper nouns. Don’t use capitals unless they’re needed grammatically.

Quick guide to using capitals:

| Type | Example |
| ---- | ------- |
| Days of the week | Sunday, Monday |
| Months | January (but NOT seasons: summer/winter) |
| Holidays and holy days | Christmas, Easter, Ramadan |
| Laws and acts | Housing Reform Bill |
| Most trade names | Sellotape, Mars bar |
| Formal titles | Prime Minister, Councillor |
| Planets and heavenly bodies | Mars, Earth, the Milky Way |
| Continents | Australia, Africa |
| Streets, roads and motorways | County Way, M1 |
| Landforms | the Peak District, the Sahara Desert |
| Bodies of water | River Rother, River Don |
| Languages | English, Spanish |

Common council terms and when to capitalise them:

| Capitals | Lowercase |
| -------- | --------- |
| Barnsley Council<br/>Barnsley Council serves… | the council says <br/> the council minutes |
| Councillor Smith | the councillor speaks <br/> councillors met |
| Local Government Association | the government |
| Adults and Communities; Development, Environment and Culture | the department is responsible for |
| Joan Smith, Web Manager | the web manager for Barnsley Council |

## Commas

Commas are used in lists within a sentence:

> We are responsible for schools, colleges and other educational establishments.

Only include a comma before the word ‘and’ if leaving it out would cause confusion.

The comma may mark off a word or phrase: You, perhaps, think otherwise.

It can also separate descriptive phrases: Councillor Smith, an elected member, will also attend.

Commas also indicate a small pause that would occur in normal speech.

## Colon and semicolon

The main purpose of the colon is to point forward, indicating ‘here it comes’. In the same way, introduce a list with a colon:

* a pencil
* a pen
* a crayon

The semi-colon links two strongly associated (or contrasting) clauses or sentences.

He knows local government inside out; he has worked as an officer all his life.

Pop into your local library; it’s full of books and things to do.

## Contractions

Contractions mean shortened forms of words or word groups. In this case we use it to refer to shortening verbs.

Use common contractions when producing web content, as they help users scan content and they’re friendlier.

| Don’t use | Do use |
| --------- | ------ |
| could’ve, should’ve, would’ve (these can be hard to read) | we’ll, you’ll, we’ve, can’t, won’t, isn’t, aren’t, and so on |

## Dashes

In practice, you’ll use a hyphen on screen in all the cases described below.

That’s because we recommend you don’t use the dash for onscreen text. We’ve included the guidance in the interests of clarity and if you come across hyphens and dashes in a print medium.

The dash – (actually called en dash) can be typed in two ways: Ctrl + minus key or use the symbol tab in the Insert menu in Word.

The en dash is longer than the hyphen and is used for different purposes.

It can be used like a strong comma to separate off an additional point towards the end of a clause or sentence. This kind of dash has a space either side:

* The chairman said he had resigned – he was, in fact, dismissed.

The dash can also be used in a pair, like brackets but slightly weightier. This kind of dash also has a space either side:

* The internet – not the TV – is now our biggest source of information.

It can link words (but not hyphenate them) in a way that stands for ‘and’ or ‘to’. This kind of dash has no spaces either side:

* London–Glasgow train
* 1939–45 (but single year: 2003/4)
* 16–19-year-old students

## Dates

We write our dates like this:

* 25 December 2012

Not like this:

* 25th December 2012
* December 25th 2012
* 25 December 12

We spell days of the week and months in full:

* Monday not Mon, January not Jan
* on 10 September …10 September 2013 … September 2013

Other examples include:

* 1990s (no apostrophe)
* the 20th century … 20th-century trends
* the class of 2007
* 1922–27 or in full when crossing century boundary, 1997–2009
* 26 October–15 November
* for financial year 1998/99, 1999/2000, 2000/02

## Downloadable files

Write the title of the document, then put file type and size in brackets.

Remember: check your links before publishing any content.

## Dot dot dot

Three dots (…) – known as an ‘ellipsis’ – are used to indicate a pause in text or an unfinished piece of text.

Use three dots only, with no space between the last word and the first dot, but a space before any word that follows on.

* There’s a lot to say about it… we’ll cover everything off in this leaflet.

## Eg, etc and ie

Shouldn’t have any full stops: eg, etc and ie

A full stop after each letter, as in e.g., is seen as old-fashioned.

## Emphasis

Emphasis should normally be expressed by bold text.

Never underline or use capitals for emphasis.

## Gender

Where appropriate, use a plural noun.

| Don’t say | Do say |
| --------- | ------ |
| The customer can access their account | Customers can access their accounts |

Avoid using the masculine singular (‘he’). Use ‘they’ if possible, or ‘his or her’.

## Hyphens

Use a hyphen to avoid ambiguity when joining words together (to make a compound word), such as cross-section.

Where compound words come before a noun or verb, they are compound modifiers. An example often used to explain these compound modifiers is ‘man-eating shark’ (a shark that eats people) as opposed to a ‘man eating shark’ (with chips and peas).

Examples we might use:

* start-up meeting
* sign-up process
* long-term investment
* 16-year-old students

But note the following do not include hyphens:

* the customer has signed up
* the investment may pay off in the long term
* he is 40 years old

## Italics

Avoid them on screen.

Single quotation marks are better if you’re writing about a report or publication.

## Links and web addresses

Only use http:// for web addresses which don’t have a ‘www’ prefix.

Otherwise, the http:// can be deleted.

## Link copy

Be simple and descriptive, always telling the user what to expect.

## Money

For round figures, miss out the empty decimal places – £1 not £1.00.

Don’t use pound signs on sums under £1. So 55p, not £0.55.
Write million in body text (use m only in tables) – £2.5 million not £2,500,000.

£30 a week, not £30 per week.

Write other currencies in full in body text; use symbols in tables or captions.
$50 (US dollars), euro and cent: no caps, € = euro symbol (normally, Ctrl + Alt + 4).

## Numbers

Tips about writing numbers:

Use words for:

* the numbers one to nine
* approximate or rounded numbers: about a million pounds, half a million customers
* ordinal numbers: first, second, third (not firstly, secondly, thirdly) then 10th etc
* numbers at the beginning of a sentence: Eleven ways to …
* clock times not followed by am or pm: three o’clock
* simple fractions: two thirds, seven eighths

Use figures for:

* numbers after nine: 10, 11, 12 etc
* numbers appearing in tables
* page numbers: page 8, section 7
* when the number is referred to as a number: divided by 3
* comparing: between 3 and 12 customers
* before units of measure: 1 mile, 20cm, 49kg, £1, 9am, 25–29kg (no need to repeat unit) but 
* 5 million–10 million (where the first unit needs clarifying)
* for whole numbers and fractions or awkward fractions: 2 1/2, 1/57
* with decimals and percentages: 2.5%
* in sections where numbers are frequent: 3 oranges, 4 apples, 2 plums
* for educational terms: level 1, Key Stage 2
* for latitude, longitude, temperature, price, score, date, time of day
* always use commas with more than four figures in text: 12,760 and 1,693,452 (but 1098), but use spaces for * numbers in columns and tables: 10 750 30 456

Use ‘more than’ instead of ‘over’ to mean ‘in excess of’. Both are grammatically fine, but ‘more than’ is our preference.

* More than 3 million customers … 

## Quotations

Short quotations of 40 words or less can be run into the text (not italic).

> The councillor said: “Things have improved around here.”

Longer quotations should appear on their own, with a line space above and below. They should be contained in double speech marks.

> “Things have improved around here since the community group was set up. They’ve accessed funding, organised volunteering and really reached out to local people.”

Don’t combine speech marks and italics.

The source details (author, date) should be placed below the quotation, on the next line and aligned with the right-hand margin. Source details should be listed in full in the reference list.

> “Things have improved around here.”
> Councillor Smith, 20 March 2013

Three dots (…) indicate where material has been omitted from the quotation. They are not needed at the beginning or end of a quotation. 

## Singular and plural nouns

When writing about an organisation, we use the singular:

* Barnsley Council serves a population of…
* Berneslai Homes is a housing company…

## Spacing

Leave one space at the end of a sentence after a full stop, not two.

Leaving two spaces is considered old-fashioned

## Speech marks

Use double quotation marks to communicate speech.

* The mayor commented “It’s an historic day for Barnsley and we welcome this news”.

Single quotation marks are for short phrases (not speech) within text.

* The theme of this year’s Deaf Awareness Week is ‘get involved, get aware’. 

To quote within a speech quote, use single quotation marks.

* A cabinet spokesperson explained the proposals: “this is a part of an ongoing programme to ensure the long-term feasibility of services described as ‘essential and valuable’ in a recent council report”.

Punctuation inside the speech marks applies only to that part of the sentence.

Also, enclose slang and technical terms in single quotation marks. For example, when introducing a new term, the word will be in ‘single’ quotation marks initially. Only do this the first time it appears.

## Spell-check

Take care when using a spellchecker – it won’t always pick up mistakes such as using ‘practice’ instead of ‘practise’ or typing ‘rouge’ instead of ‘rogue’.

It may also miss some American spellings which would be considered wrong in British English, such as ‘color’ and ‘neighborhood’. There really is no substitute for having your work checked over by another person!

## Titles and menu tabs

Titles and menu tabs should use capitals only for the first letter of the first word of the title, and for proper names within the title. Don’t use a full stop at the end.

Job titles are different. If the job title comes after the person’s name, capitalise: J Smith, Brand Manager.

If the job title comes before the person’s name, don’t capitalise: brand manager John Smith.

## Titles of official schemes and initiatives

Capitalise titles of this type, as they are proper nouns.

If you’re not sure, search for the correct spelling online. It’s best to do this on the organisation or scheme’s own website to get it right.
