Inside Barnsley Council we often use jargon, phrases and words that do not mean anything to our customers.

To help people better understand us, we should structure our information in a better way and remove unnecessary words.

## Put yourself in the user’s shoes

Think about the goal or task the user is coming to the website with. How are you going to help them achieve that?

What’s the best way for your content to be presented? Be clear on the purpose of the content you’re writing and if you get stuck, remind yourself of what the user is likely to be looking for.

To help customers in this way, we should include at least one ‘call to action’ on every page that we create. A call to action is something that tries to get the visitor to do something – usually a link, e-form or download. It should be expressed with an action word – ‘apply’, ‘register’, ‘buy’, or just ‘find out more’. To make your main call to action prominent, put it towards the end of the page, ideally on a line by itself. In some cases, the call to action may actually need to appear near the top of the page. Finally, make sure you provide enough information on the page to enable the customer to decide whether they should follow the call to action – or choose the right one for them.

## Plan your structure

Very few of us get structure right instinctively. You need to plan out what your audience wants to know, what you’re going to say and how it will develop.

Setting a word limit helps. Consider your users most obvious question and answer that first, then consider their next likely question, and so on. The inverted pyramid paragraph in section 3 of this document explains more.

## One idea per paragraph

This rule builds on the last one. Sticking to one idea per paragraph helps with structure, clarity and readability

It’s particularly important when writing online, where users read more quickly and scan for content that’s relevant to them.

## Keep sentences short

Keep the average length of your sentences to 15–20 words.

You’ll write sentences longer and shorter than this – but this should be the average length. Long sentences are difficult to read; many readers will lose track halfway through. There are two ways to break down a very long sentence: split it into shorter sentences; or, if it includes a list of words or points, turn it into bullet points.

## Use punctuation correctly

Punctuation is a huge topic in itself, but a good rule of thumb is to punctuate where you would naturally pause, or take a breath, if you were speaking.

Reading your words back to yourself out loud will help you focus on the meaning as well – where the different ideas need to be separated off.

| Don’t say | Do say |
| --------- | ------ |
| Libraries now offer access to IT resources online and can often help to get people started on their online journey by offering short introductory classes or taster sessions | Libraries now offer access to IT resources online; they can often help to get people started on their online journey, by offering short introductory classes or taster sessions |

Here, we’ve added a comma and, to separate off the first bit, a semi-colon. A semi-colon is a bit stronger than a comma – but not as much of a break as a full stop. You could have a full stop here – but because there’s a sense of flow between the ideas, and because ‘they’ refers back to ‘libraries’, we want more of a sense of continuity, so a semi-colon seems right.

## Get rid of unnecessary words

Users want to get to the point of our message, fast. Words that add nothing to the meaning should be deleted.

For example:

| Don’t say | Do say |
| --------- | ------ |
| The proposal that was received from… | The proposal from… |
| We are in the process of preparing a policy statement… | We are preparing a policy statement… |
| We enclose herewith an invoice… | We enclose an invoice… |
| Barnsley Council is currently developing… | Barnsley Council is developing… |

## Tell it like it is

Sounds easy, doesn’t it? Yet plain-speaking content is one of the hardest things to get right.

By using everyday words in the right places, you can give your content a lighter touch. It’s the difference between saying ‘ask for help’ rather than ‘request assistance’. Or ‘we’ll have a chat about your skills’ instead of ‘we’ll discuss your skills’. But remember, ‘telling it like it is’ isn’t the same thing as using slang.

## Use subheadings

Using subheadings makes your copy more readable.

Web users expect it and it’s a good rule of thumb for most communication channels. Subheadings give the reader a heads-up on what to expect from a longer section, helping them to understand content quickly and more easily.

It’s often a good idea to use questions as subheadings, eg ‘Who can foster children?’ A subheading can also be something that covers the action that the customer may want to take, eg ‘How to register as a childminder’.

## Edit your work and ask for a second opinion

Don’t expect to get your copy right first time. The most experienced copywriters edit, revise and redraft their work.

It’s an essential part of the writing process. A second pair of eyes is invaluable when it comes to checking your work. Ask a colleague whose opinion you trust to read your copy and share their thoughts. It’s likely they’ll spot a couple of things you’ve missed or give you some feedback that could improve your draft. Last but not least, get your copy proofed before it goes anywhere.

## Avoid jargon

It’s easy in any organisation to slip into using jargon or ‘business speak’. One of the reasons we use it is to sound professional or to tiptoe round a topic.

On the web, there’s nowhere to hide. By using jargon or business speak, we run the risk of alienating our customers and visitors to our website. Plus people with lower reading ages can find jargon tricky to grasp. Avoid jargon, speak plainly and think of another way of saying that term that you’re trying hard not to use. The same goes for clichés – they make copy sound tired rather than energetic and fresh.

Here are a few examples of business-speak, with suggested replacements:

| Don’t use | Do use |
| --------- | ------ |
| advise | tell |
| additional | extra, more |
| ensure | make sure |
| complete | fill in |
| negligible | small, low |
| on receipt | when you / we get |
| regarding | about |
| whilst | while |
| magnitude | size |

# Web content principles

The most important thing to consider when writing for the web is what users want.

How many times have you been on a site that asks you millions of questions before being given access to the information or tasks you want? Or have you been waylaid by confusing navigation? Were you frustrated? Did you abandon your task or pick up the phone instead?

When a visitor comes to http://www.barnsley.gov.uk (new window), they have a level of goodwill. And to establish trust in our website, we need to make sure we keep this level high. Words are a vital tool for doing this. Even before visitors get to our site.

These next principles for producing great web content should keep us on track and help us design the best possible experience for our customers.

## Visual clarity

Writing for the web is not the same as writing for print.

Perhaps the simplest rule is to have a think about how you read when you’re browsing the web. Use headlines, small amounts of bold (not underlines) to highlight key words, and bulleted lists to make it easy to understand the key points.

## Active, not passive

If you construct a sentence so that the person or thing on the receiving end is upfront, you’re probably using the ‘passive voice’:

* You will be contacted…
* Performance is measured…
* It is assumed that…

It’s better to avoid the passive voice as much as you can in your writing, as it tends to sound formal, vague and unfriendly.

The ‘active voice’ – where we talk about someone actually doing something – usually comes across as sharper and more customer-focused:

| Don’t say | Do say |
| --------- | ------ |
| Household waste will be collected once a week | We collect household waste once a week |

Where you can, it’s often a good idea to use the ‘imperative’ – this is a type of active voice where we don’t use ‘we’ or ‘you’ at all, because we’re giving an instruction – ‘do this’. For example:

> To apply for a permit, complete a Club Gaming Application Form.

It’s not about barking orders at the reader, but about being direct and unambiguous, motivating the reader and striking a confident tone. It’s a good option.

If you’re trying to involve the reader by using ‘you’, it’s easy to fall into the trap of using the passive:

> You will be assessed under the rules…

This doesn’t say who’s doing the assessing – the customer is just having it done to them. In this case, it would be better to say ‘we will assess your situation according to the rules…’

### When the passive is okay

The passive voice is not banned altogether: in certain situations, it can be your best option.

* To make something less hostile: ‘The bill has not been paid’ sounds less accusing than ‘You have not paid the bill’.
* To avoid taking the blame: ‘A mistake was made’ rather than ‘We made a mistake’.
* When you don’t know who did it: ‘A decision was taken…’.
* If it helps the wording or just sounds better: ‘The stadium plans were approved’ – if it doesn’t matter who approved the plans, it’s good to get the important words up front.

These are exceptions though. About 80 to 90% of the verbs that you use should be active.

## Microcopy

‘Microcopy’ means the little bits of text on websites that offer help and instructions to visitors.

This includes things like form labels, pop-up messages, the text on buttons, and the names of links. These all provide opportunities for us to reassure the visitor by given them a useful tip, just at the point where they need it.

For example, when a customer is filling in a form to pay a parking fine, what should the ‘action button’ say? Add to basket? Pay now? Proceed? It’s important that we think through the implications of the words we use in situations like this, and don’t dash them off at the last minute, or leave them to others (such as developers) to write.

Here are a few tips to use when you’re called on to generate microcopy:

* Walk through the process as if you were the customer.
* Provide reassurance – but not extra words for the sake of it. If you want to provide extra information only to people who actually request it, consider putting it behind a help (‘?’) or information (‘i’) button.
* Don’t make too many assumptions about the user’s level of understanding.
* Offer help at the point where it’s needed.
* Avoid jargon at all costs.

## Scannability

Focus on ‘scannability’ – most users scan screens more than they read them, so make sure your copy is easy to interpret at a glance.

Copy should be ‘chunked up’ for screen – see the inverted pyramid principle below.

## The inverted pyramid principle

Write your copy so that the most important information is at the top – that way, people who only read your opening paragraph can still get a clear idea of what that page is about.

This differs to writing for print, where the opening paragraph is often used as an attention grabber and you have the luxury of developing ideas over a number of pages.

## Capitals in headings, menus and titles

Whenever you write a new heading, menu item or article title make sure you use sentence case (only capitalise the first word).

You can still capitalise any words that need it. For example:

* Special educational needs
* Schools in Barnsley
* The council’s Corporate Plan

## Writing links

Make links meaningful: ‘Click here’ and ‘Find out more’ don’t let the user know what to expect from their next action.

‘Download the latest report’ and ‘Find your nearest grit bin’ tell them exactly what they need to know about where they’re going next. This is best practice and is actually a legal requirement of the W3C AA accessibility guidelines.
