    #BORDER-BOX SETTINGS
\*------------------------------------*/

/**
 * Tells browsers to keep boxes contained within themselves. In other words
 * when we add padding or borders, they are included on the inside of the box 
 * boundary, not on the outside which would make their overall widths larger. 
 * If widths grow, elements end up misaligned - this takes care of that.
